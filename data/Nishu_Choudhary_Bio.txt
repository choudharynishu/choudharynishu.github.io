\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Nishu Choudhary is a Doctoral candidate at Georgia Tech in Transportation Engineering Department. Her doctoral thesis focuses on the identification of traffic congestion precursors using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The proposed thesis will enable Traffic Management Centers (TMCs) to proactively implement real-time congestion mitigation strategies leading to more energy-efficient transportation systems\
\
Previously, she worked on a traffic operation project involving system delay analysis and an experimental study on driver intersection blocking analysis. She has a Masters in Transportation Engineering from Georgia Tech and a Bachelor's degree with Honors in Civil Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay. \
\
She also frequently participates in volunteering and mentoring activities in student chapters of ITE and ASHE at Georgia Tech, as well as her local community.}
